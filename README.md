# 2015-OSCAR
## Multi-agent system OSCAR (OOP). In 2015.

Mutli-agent system where the so-called "world" is a 2d grid in which different kinds of "agents" evolve (some can move, reproduce, fight, attract or repulse the other and so on). 
The user provides the initial state of the world via a text file, and the program gives the evolution of the population of agents. 

In the code: there is a separation between the kernel where the different world and agent class, together with their respective methods, are implemented, and the text interface and graphical interface.
